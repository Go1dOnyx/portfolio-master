            I'm Jesus Diaz, a graduate from Brookhaven College at Farmers Branch, TX. I graduated 
            with an Associate's Degree as a Software Developer and recieved my certfications as a 
            Computer Programmer and in Microsoft Word. I'm Full Stack Developer for Elite Devz, 
            Graphic Designer and Computer Technician from Dallas, TX. I've worked with various CRUD and 
            RESTful applications that include a power dailer system, crawler Web API application that 
            is a microservice for other applications to use to gather relevant information from websites.
            I've managed the databases for these applications using SSMS and Azure, but I'm also
            familiar with MySQL or NoSQL databases. I'm currently building my own ecommerce store, known 
            as Zym or Zymbiote. This is a huge project that I'm working on my own to sell clothing from 
            my own graphic designs using Photoshop and ProCreate.
